# React-App-Main
This project is an application that will be used by demos llc. The aim of our application is to provide a better link between
local government and local constituents. We hope to provide content in the form of bipartisan videos and articles describing 
the happenings of local government, and then create a filtered version of that content on a case by case basis to our users so
they are able to engage in the information they are most passionate about. Our platform also lets citizens provide feedback to
their leaders in government by allowing for survey responses to articles and direct open-ended feedback to government officials.
